    "## Steps to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. review types of variable stars, the history, and interesting effects.\n",
    "2. mess with eq.(14.7) and eq.(14.8) in Carrol & Ostile 2nd. ed to make a mathematical model.\n",
    "3. Find a variable star with known data and period to compare to my model.\n",
    "4. combine all into a 30ish min presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For the DiffEq:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. read through computational book to find information about 2nd order DiffEq. Use Runga-Cutta\n",
    "2. Code the linear case with the simple model in Ex. 14.3.1.\n",
    "3. Try the nonlinear case.\n",
    "4. compare to chosen variable star."
